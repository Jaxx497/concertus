# Themeing

 This document is designed to layout the specifications of the Concertus
 themeing format. Should any changes be made, they should be reflected here,
 and laid out in the example below.

Several examples of custom themes can be seen [here](./theme_examples/).

Current theme specification: `v1.0`

### Hot keys

The theme menu can be accessed via the `Ctrl`+`c` keymap. Attempt to hot reload
the current them with `F6`. This will hot reload all themes, no need to reboot
when testing changes. Themes can also be cycled through via the `Shift`+`<` and
`Shift`+`>` keys. (Note: Using these keys does not reload recent changes, it
only cycles through the most recently loaded themes).

### Theme Folder Location & Formatting

Themes should be placed in the `$CONFIG/concertus/themes` directory. This
folder will be autogenerated after running concertus for the first time. 

Any number of themes can be placed into the folder, there is no limit. Should a
theme fail to follow the specification (i.e. has missing fields, contains
typos, fail to comply with the TOML parser, etc.) the theme will not be loaded,
nor will any errors be thrown. If a theme is not displaying, review the
formatting and any potential typos (such as forgetting quotation marks,
forgetting the `#`, or using colons instead of equal signs).

Here is an example of a transparent theme:

```Toml 
# Concertus Transparent.toml

# Theme specification v1.0
[colors]
surface_global      = "" # Background of application [empty fields will attempt to render transparency]
surface_active      = "" # Background of selected pane
surface_inactive    = "" # Background of unselected areas
surface_error       = "#ff4646" # Color of error popup

text_primary        = "#d2d2d7"
text_secondary      = "#ff4646"
text_secondary_in   = "#a62e2e" # Secondary text in unfocused panes
text_selection      = "#0a0a0d"
text_muted          = "#646468"

border_active       = "#dcdc64"
border_inactive     = "#343438"

selection           = "#dcdc64" # Selected item
selection_inactive  = "#82823C" # Multi-selected & unfocused selections

accent              = "#dcdc64" 
accent_inactive     = "#82823C"

progress            = ["#ff0000", "#ffffff", "#0000ff"] 
                        # A single color value is also allowed

progress_i          # [OPTIONAL]    
                    = "dimmed"
                        # Other options values include
                        #   "dimmed"    => a faded version of the above field [default]
                        #   "still"     => a frozen version of the gradient
                        #   "#ff4646"   => a solid single color
                        #   ["#ff0000", "#ffffff", "#0000ff"

progress_speed      = 8.0   # Defaults to 6.0 if field is not supplied.
                            # Recommended to use an even value here.
                            # 0 Will disable any scrolling, negative values will reverse direction

[borders]   # These fields are optional, defaults shown
border_display      = "all"
border_type         = "rounded"

[extras]    # These fields are optional, defaults shown
is_dark             = true  # Defaults to true
decorator           = "✧"   # Recommended to use a utf8 compliant character here
```

### Acceptable Color Formats

Colors should be formatted as their hexidecimal representations, enclosed in
double quotes: `"#XXXXXX"`

For those who wish to utilize transparency, simply leave the quotes empty or
write "none" with the quotation marks. (Certain elements may not be able to be
rendered as transparent. Your terminal may also play a role in what can/cannot
be transparent.)

### Theme Tricks
Users can create a borderless experience by setting the colors of the borders
to the same values as the respective background panel colors. However, there is
no way to set transparent borders. Users can also set border_display to "none",
although this may affect the padding of some elements.

The same principle applies to the selection colors- Instead of a highlighted
column, try setting the highlight color to the same color as the background,
and the highlighted text to a distinct color. Test the results!
