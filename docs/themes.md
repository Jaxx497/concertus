# Themeing

> **Disclaimer:** Themeing in Concertus is currently in an experimental stage. This document will reflect the most recent changes to the themeing engine, as well as the latest specification.

Current specification: 0.2 

### Hot keys

The theme menu can be accessed via the `Ctrl`+`c` keymap. This will hot
reload all themes, no need to reboot when making changes to a theme. Themes can
also be cycled through via the `Shift`+`<` and `Shift`+`>` keys. (These will
not be hot reloaded).

### Theme Folder Location & Formatting

Themes should be placed in the $CONFIG/concertus/themes folder. This folder
will be autogenerated after running concertus for the first time. 

Any number of themes can be placed into the folder, there is no limit. Should a
theme fail to follow the specification (i.e. has missing fields, contains
typos, fail to comply with the TOML parser, etc.) the theme will not be
accessible to the user in the program.

Here is an example of a transparent theme:

```Toml 
# Theme version 0.3
``name = "Transparent 1"

[colors]
surface_global      = "" # Background of application
surface_active      = "" # Background of selected pane
surface_inactive    = "" # Background of unselected areas
surface_error       = "#ff4646" # Color of error popup

text_primary        = "#d2d2d7"
text_secondary      = "#ff4646"
text_secondary_in   = "#a62e2e" # Secondary text in unfocused panes
text_selection      = "#0a0a0d"
text_muted          = "#646468"

border_active       = "#dcdc64"
border_inactive     = "#343438"

selection           = "#dcdc64" # Selected item
selection_inactive  = "#82823C" # Multi-selected & unfocused selections

accent              = "#dcdc64" 
accent_inactive     = "#82823C"

progress            = ["#ff0000", "#ffffff", "#0000ff"] 
                    # Or "ff0000"

[borders]
border_display      = "all"
border_type         = "rounded"
```

### Acceptable Color Formats

Colors can be formatted in rgb `"rgb(###, ###,###)"`, `"#XXXXXX"`, or as
generic color names. E.g. "red", "light-blue".* All inputs are case insensitive.
For those who wish to utilize transparency, simply leave the quotes empty or
write "none" with the quotation marks. (Certain elements may not be able to be
rendered as transparent. Your terminal may also play a role in what can/cannot
be transparent.)

```TOML
# Valid Colors
surface_global = ""
text_primary = "#Ff4646" # Lowercase and uppercase allowed
text_secondary =  "rgb(142, 32, 200)"
border_inactive = "grey"

# Invalid Colors
text_focused = "FF4646" # Missing the `#` character
text_secondary = "(132, 132, 55)" # Missing rgb qualifier
```

> \* Using generic color strings will fallback on ANSI terminal color
> codes. These will not interpolate properly with gradients. 

Users can create a borderless experience by setting the colors of the borders
to the same values as the respective background panel colors. This will **not**
work with transparent backgrounds.
