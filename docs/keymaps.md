Because Concertus is a modal program, keymaps depend on the specific context in
which they are used. Contexts are defined by a combination of the mode (e.g.
Playlist, Queue, Album, Search) and the Pane (e.g. Main pane, sidebar, popup,
etc.). Global keymaps and playback keymaps will work in almost every context,
with the exception of searching as not to affect a user's search query. 

**Keymaps are case sensitive.**
